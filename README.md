# General Assembly Chicago Data Science - Winter 2015

## Course Description
Welcome to General Assembly's Chicago Data Science course! This is a foundational course in data science focusing on theory, applications, and real world problems. Students will learn multiple techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning in both regression and classification settings. In addition, students will gain the theoretical backbone for deciding which tools to use. Students will learn how to use the Pandas and scikit-learn packages in Python to build and validate their prediction models.
