# Project Details
The final project represents a culmination of the methodologies and techniques students have learned throughout the course. While students should continuously work with instructors and discuss ideas with other students, the work should be their own.

The project should address a data-related problem in your professional field or a field you are interested in. You will be asked to acquire a real-world data set, form a hypothesis about it, clean, parse, and apply modeling techniques and data analysis principles to ultimately create a predictive model.

Deliverables include a technical paper as well as a final presentation on the last day of class.  

The technical paper should be directed toward the instructors and include:
* Description of problem and hypothesis
* Description of your data
* In depth detail of model(s) used
* 


The in-class presentation should be directed toward your student peers and be aimed at 7 minutes in length with 2-3 minutes of questions. 

##  Overall


## Milestone 1 - Due Dec 21
### Problem Defined and Dataset Gathered
By the first milestone, you should have obtained a sizeable dataset and defined a problem of interest. You may use data from a field you are interested in or a Kaggle competition. DO check with your instructors prior to the milestone to get guidance with defining the problem. 

### Deliverable:
* Link to dataset - Feel free to include a hyperlink, Google Drive link, etc.
* PDF - In a one paragraph summary (5-10 sentences), describe the dataset, and the problem. Is this a supervised or unsupervised problem and is it in a regression or classification setting? Do you have any potential issues regarding the data or problem?


## Milestone 2
### Initial Data Exploration
By milestone 2, you should have explored and visualized your data. You should in addition be able to answer qualitative questions about your dataset. Are there a lot of NA values? If so, can these be imputed or surrogate variables used? If not, how will you handle them? Are there a lot of outlier values--how will you handle these? What are your chosen features--are they raw values or transformed? Why did you choose these features? What charts or displays can you use to aggregate or describe the information? In addition, build at least one model even if it has low predictive abilities out of sample. 

### Deliverable:
* PDF - In addition to the refined summary, include answers to the above questions as well as any other observations and thoughts about the data. Details about your initial model should go here as well as supporting charts and graphs. 


## Milestone 3
### Significant Data Exploration

Significant project progress available. Multiple techniques or variants have been explored. Charts and graphs explaining data and approach available.

## Milestone 4
Final paper and presentation are complete.
